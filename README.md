# Mining VLASS data for transients

The Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS, https://science.nrao.edu/vlass) is a synoptic survey of the 33,885 square degrees of the radio sky in the 2 to 4 GHz frequency range. This repository focuses on analyzing the epoch1 data from the VLASS survey to identify and study transients.
